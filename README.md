# Interplay between glucose and acetate metabolisms in *Escherichia coli*

## Overview

These R scripts perform all analyses detailed in the following publication:

The model is available in COPASI format in the `./model/` directory, and in SBML format from the Biomodels database (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/) under identifier MODEL2005050001. Details on the model can be found in the original publication (Millard et al., 2021, eLife, doi: [10.7554/eLife.63661](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.63661)) and at https://github.com/MetaSys-LISBP/acetate_regulation. Experimental data are provided in the `./data/` directory. Calculation results and figures are saved in the `./results/` directory.

Details on the calculations can be found in the [original publication](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.09.20.506926) and in the R scripts.

The code is open-source and available under [GPLv3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.txt).

## Dependencies

Some R packages are required.

`RColorBrewer`, `gplots`, `pso` and `optimx` can be installed
by running the following command in an R console:

```bash
install.packages(c("RColorBrewer", "gplots", "pso", "optimx"))
```

`CoRC` can be installed
using the following commands:

```bash
install.packages("remotes")
library(remotes)
remotes::install_github("jpahle/CoRC")
library(CoRC)
CoRC::getCopasi()
```

Additional information on CoRC installation and usage are available from the CoRC repository (https://github.com/jpahle/CoRC) and the associated publication (FÃ¶ster et al., Bioinformatics, 2021, doi: [10.1093/bioinformatics/btab033](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab033)).

## Usage

To run all analyses detailed in the publication and reproduce Figures 1-4, 6 and 7:

- download the [GitHub repository tarball](https://github.com/pierremillard/glucose_acetate_interplay/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and unpack it somewhere on your disk

- open a terminal

- go to the code directory, e.g.:

```bash
cd /home/usr/data/glucose_acetate_interplay/
```

- open an R session:

```bash
R
```

- run simulations, generate all figures and perform statistical analyses with:

```bash
source("run_calculations.R")
```

All results will be saved in the `./results/` directory.
